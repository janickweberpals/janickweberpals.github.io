%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\aboutme{I'm a healthcare data scientist with 8+ years of experience in the design and analysis of large \textit{real-world} clinical database studies in both industry and academia. I'm passionate about the integration of various data modalities (EHR, claims, genomics, imaging, NLP) using deep learning to solve problems in healthcare and causal inference. In addition, I have gained deep clinical knowledge mainly in the fields of cancer but also other disease areas. I have (co-) authored 25+ peer-reviewed methodological and clinical publications and received several awards.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
