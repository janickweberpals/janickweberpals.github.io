## Music

I love playing music myself. I have been playing drums since the age of 7 and guitar since the age of 14. 

Check out some of my latest recordings:

**Janick Weberpals - Weekend in the City**

Still some of the most memorable music moments I have had, was with *Story of my life* (sorry about the bad quality, smartphones had not existed by that time):

**Story of my life - Of a song that changed the world**

## Travelling, video editing and aviation

One of the things I like most when exploring new places is to capture the moment using timelapse videos.
